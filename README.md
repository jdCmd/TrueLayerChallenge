# TrueLayerChallenge

This repository contains my solution to the TrueLayer developer challenge. I have completed the solution using C#.

The solution is comprised of a Web API with a supplementary Swagger endpoint. There is also a [Dockerfile](.\TrueLayerChallenge\TrueLayerChallenge.WebApi\Dockerfile) included for running the app within a docker container.
